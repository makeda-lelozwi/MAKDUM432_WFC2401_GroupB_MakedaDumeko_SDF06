## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
For the SDF06 submission we were tasked with using CSS to develope a simplified Instagram profile. We had to use CSS selectors (like @Media) and properties (like flex-wrap) to make the profile visually appealing and responsive to different screen-sizes. 

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I was quite efficient at knowing which selectors to target.  
- **Responsive Design**: I was able to correctly use media   queries to make sure that the content was displayed well aon desktop and mobile device screens
- 

#### Challenges Faced
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: Everytime I hovered over a post, it would show the next post and make it too big. But I go tsome help from a classmate and fixed the problem. 

- **Styling Elements**: I had trouble with making the instagram profile look close to the real Instagram because the page doesn't have many colours or visible borders that I could use to gauge how big things should be. Again, my classmates came to the rescue. 

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I need more practice with using flexbox and understanding how the display property works.
- **Creative Design Choices**: I think with more time I will be confident to add my own stylistic choices to my projects. 

#### Overall Learning Experience
 This project was very eye-opening in how creative the developers who create the websites we use everyday are. Not only creative, but I'm sure they understand very well how the computer "thinks" so that they can feed it the right information to get the desired outcome. This realisation made me even more motivated to learn software development and become a good developer. And I also learned how valuable teamwork and collaboration is. That is a continuous lesson that I have learned in the first month of this program.
